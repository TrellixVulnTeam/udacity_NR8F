fork
This concept of "forking" is also different from "cloning". When you clone a repository, you get an identical copy of the repository. But cloning happens on your local machine and you clone a remote repository. When you fork a repository, a new duplicate copy of the remote repository is created. This new copy is also a remote repository, but it now belongs to you.
