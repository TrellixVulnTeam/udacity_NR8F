NOT NULL
The NOT NULL constraint indicates that the column cannot contain a null value.

create table if not exists customer_transactions (
    customer_id int NOT NULL,
    store_id int,
    spent numeric
);

UNIQUE
The UNIQUE constraint is used to specify that the data across all the rows in one column are unique within the table.

create table if not exists customer_transactions (
    customer_id int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    store_id int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    spent numeric
);

PRIMARY KEY
The PRIMARY KEY constraint is defined on a single column, and every table should contain a primary key. The values in this column uniquely identify the rows in the table. If a group of columns are defined as a primary key, they are called a composite key. By default, the PRIMARY KEY constraint has the unique and not null constraint built into it.

create table if not exists store(
    store_id int PRIMARY KEY,
    store_loc_city text,
    store_loc_state text
);

create table if not exists customer_transactions (
    customer_id int, 
    store_id int, 
    spent numeric,
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id, store_id)
);

The primary key is made up of either just the partition key or with the addition of clustering columns. The partition key will determine the distribution of data across the system
