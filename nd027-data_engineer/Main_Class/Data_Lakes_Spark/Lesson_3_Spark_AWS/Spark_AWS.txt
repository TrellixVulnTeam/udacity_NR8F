Amazon S3 will store the dataset.
We rent a cluster of machines, i.e., our Spark Cluster, and it is located in AWS data centers. We rent these using AWS service called Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
We log in from your local computer to this Spark cluster.
Upon running our Spark code, the cluster will load the dataset from Amazon S3 into the clusterâ€™s memory distributed across each machine in the cluster.

EC2 - SSH key-pair - connect to the cluster
EMR - create Cluster - M5

You must have an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) key pair to connect to the nodes in your cluster over a secure channel using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. 
Elastic Map Reduce(EMR) is a service that provides you EC2 instances with many big data tools like hadoop and Spark already installed and configured.

alternate way to connect to AWS 
- AWS CLI create an EMR cluster

- allow EMR to accept incoming SSH protocol so your local machine can connect to your EMR cluster in the AWS Cloud
