relational databases:
RDBMS

database=schema: collection of tables
table/relation
columns/attributes
rows/tuple

SQL is the language used across almost all relational database system for querying and maintaining the database
advantages of using a relational database:
•   easy to use – SQL; 
•   ability to do joins; 
•   ability to do aggregations and analytics; 
•   smaller data volumes
•   easier to change business requirements
•   flexibility for queries
•   modeling the data not modeling queries
•   Secondary Indexes available : You have the advantage of being able to add another index to help with quick 
searching.
•   ACID Transactions: data integrity
 
When Not to Use a Relational Database?
•   Have large amounts of data
•   Need to be able to store different data type formats: Relational databases are not designed to handle unstructured data.
•   Need high throughput -- fast reads
•   Need a flexible schema
•   Need high availability
•   Need horizontal scalability: Horizontal scalability is the ability to add more machines or nodes to a system to increase performance and space for data


Allows you to meet a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, and thus maintain data integrity.

What is ACID: 
•   Atomicity (The whole transaction is processed or nothing is processed.)
全成功或者全失败 没有中间状态 All or nothing: transfer money from check to saving
•   Consistency (Only transactions that abide by constraints and rules are written into the database, otherwise the database keeps the previous state)
只有符合条件的transactions才会被写进database； column=bool
•   Isolation (Transactions are processed independently and securely, order does not matter. A low level of isolation enables many users to access the data simultaneously, however this also increases the possibilities of concurrency effects (e.g., dirty reads or lost updates). On the other hand, a high level of isolation reduces these chances of concurrency effects, but also uses more system resources and transactions blocking each other)
多个用户多个transaction无干扰
•   Durability (Completed transactions are saved to database even in cases of system failure)
写完之后不用丢失
