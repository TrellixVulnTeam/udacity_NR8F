Delete a Redshift Cluster
Make sure to delete your cluster each time you're finished working to avoid large, unexpected costs. You can always launch a new cluster, so don't leave it running overnight or throughout the week if you don't need to.

EC2: server (compute unit + storage unit)
create an IAM role
create security group
launch a redshift role
create an IAM user
create s3 bucket (s3 like hard drive) 
upload to s3
create a PostgreSQL RDS (create database)

S3 offers a very reliable, scalable and worry-free storage solution, but it only offers storage not processing power.

Key recommendations for using your AWS credits wisely:
Delete your Amazon Redshift cluster each time you're finished working.
Use a smaller subset of your data while you code and debug on AWS, and only execute with the full dataset on AWS as a final test of your code.
