Apache Cassandra:
- denormalization is must
- no JOINs
- optimized for fast writes
- one table per query

PRIMARY KEY:  
PARTITION KEY + (CLUSTERING COL)
- unique!!
- hashing into number
- data is distributed by partition key

CLUSTERING COL
- sort by ascending order

Where
limitation on select *
- PARTITION KEY 
- PARTITION KEY + (CLUSTERING COL)
- PARTITION KEY + (CLUSTERING COL) + other cols
- PARTITION KEY + other cols does not work
- must use for queries
- You can not try to access a column or a clustering column if you have not used the other defined clustering column
- PRIMARY KEY must be used in WHERE in order
