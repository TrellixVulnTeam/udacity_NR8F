Upsert
In RDBMS language, the term upsert refers to the idea of inserting a new row in an existing table, or updating the row if it already exists in the table. The action of updating or inserting has been described as "upsert".

    customer_id int PRIMARY KEY, 
    customer_street varchar NOT NULL,
    customer_city text NOT NULL,
    customer_state text NOT NULL
);

INSERT into customer_address

    (432, '758 Main Street', 'Chicago', 'IL'
);

INSERT INTO customer_address (customer_id, customer_street, customer_city, customer_state)
VALUES
 (
 432, '923 Knox Street', 'Albany', 'NY'
 ) 
ON CONFLICT (customer_id) 
DO NOTHING;
